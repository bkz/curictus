Rules:

- Win32 specfic libraries are put in ./python-2.7-win32

- Portable libraries which are needed by the server/client go into ./libs

- Everything else is put in the root, i.e. this folder.

NOTE: Everything in ./libs will be automatically installed if you follow the instructions in server setup documentation.
