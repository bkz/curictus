Curictus VRS Readme
===================

This is an open-source version of Curictus VRS commercial stroke-rehabilitation
product, including hardware schematics, client software, server backend for
analytics, 12 training activities and 6 assessments.

Background
----------

Curictus has emerged as a spin-off from a research project carried out
at Sahlgrenska Academy. The project involved use of virtual reality and haptic
technology for rehabilitation after acquired brain injury.

Clinical research involving the use of the VRS in stroke rehabilitation
confirmed that VRS is a valuable and useful rehabilitation tool. The first
publication came out in 2002 and a number of other scientific papers have been
published since then. 

In April 2010 Curictus was acquired by the [http://www.jsmgruppen.com JSM
Group]. Since then, the company focused on the home market, with the goal to
raise the interest of the rehabilitation community. The market development has
not been the one we hoped for and financial considerations compel us to shut
down the company.

However, we strongly believe in the value and potential of our system and we do
not wish to let all the work, investment and gained knowledge go to waste.
Therefore, Curictus’ owner, JSM Group has decided to donate to the open source
community the results of Curictus’ work on the VR System. This website contains
the source code and documents that will allow researchers and interested
scientists to build the system and continue to develop and improve it, for the
benefits of science and patients with acquired brain injury.
