This is straight port of the bsdiff/bspatch binaries to the Win32 platform. The binaries themselves have no dependencies as they have been statically linked to both the msvcrt runtime libraries as well as to libbzip2. The following versions of bsdiff and libbzip2 were used: 

bsdiff-4.3
bzip2-1.0.5
