This folder contains the minimal set of H3D binaries and support files needed
to run X3D applications.

In order to update the contents of this folder to a new version of H3D simply
delete all folders and extract or copy all files and folders from the H3D
installation directory (normally C:\H3D) to this location and run "update.bat"
which will delete all unwanted files.
